# Ghazwa e Khandaq: A Historic Battle of Islam
 
Ghazwa e Khandaq, also known as the Battle of the Trench or the Battle of the Confederates, was a 27-day-long siege of Medina by a coalition of Arab and Jewish tribes in the year 627 CE. The Muslims, led by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), defended the city by digging a trench around it, following the advice of Salman al-Farsi (may Allah be pleased with him), a Persian companion who had witnessed similar tactics in his homeland. The trench prevented the enemy from launching a direct attack, and forced them to resort to psychological warfare, bribery, and treachery. However, the Muslims remained steadfast and resilient, trusting in Allah and His Messenger. The siege ended with the withdrawal of the confederates, who suffered heavy losses and failed to achieve their objective of destroying Islam and the Muslim community.

The Battle of the Trench is one of the most significant events in Islamic history, as it marked a turning point in the struggle between Islam and its enemies. It also demonstrated the wisdom, courage, and leadership of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), as well as the loyalty, sacrifice, and unity of his companions. The battle is mentioned in several verses of the Quran, such as Surah al-Ahzab (The Confederates), which praises the believers for their perseverance and warns the hypocrites for their betrayal. The battle also teaches us many lessons and morals that are relevant for Muslims today, such as trusting in Allah's help, being prepared for challenges, cooperating with each other, and resisting temptations.

The confederate army, led by Abu Sufyan, arrived at Medina and camped near Mount Uhud. They were surprised and frustrated by the sight of the trench, which they had never encountered before. They tried to cross it, but were repelled by the arrows and stones of the Muslims. They also attempted to fill it with dirt and wood, but failed. The siege turned into a stalemate, as neither side could gain an advantage over the other. The confederates hoped to break the morale of the Muslims by hurling insults and threats at them, but the Muslims responded with patience and prayers.
 
Meanwhile, the Banu Qurayza, a Jewish tribe that had a treaty with the Muslims, was approached by Huyayy ibn Akhtab, a leader of the Banu Nadir who had been expelled from Medina. He persuaded them to betray the Muslims and join the confederates. He also promised them the support of the Quraysh and the Ghatafan tribes. The Banu Qurayza agreed and secretly prepared to attack Medina from the south. However, their plot was exposed by some Muslim women and children who had taken refuge in their fortresses. The Prophet (peace be upon him) sent some of his companions to verify the news and found out that it was true. He then sent Sa'd ibn Mu'adh and Sa'd ibn Ubadah, two leaders of the Ansar, to negotiate with the Banu Qurayza and remind them of their treaty. But they refused to listen and insulted them instead.
 
The Prophet (peace be upon him) was now facing a grave danger from both sides. He consulted his companions and decided to deal with the external enemy first. He ordered them to remain vigilant and steadfast in their positions. He also sent some spies and emissaries to sow discord and doubt among the confederates. He managed to convince some of them, such as Banu Asad and Banu Ghifar, to leave the siege or remain neutral. He also sent a message to the Ghatafan tribe, offering them a third of the date harvest of Medina in exchange for their withdrawal. They agreed, but their offer was rejected by Allah and His Messenger, who said that they would not give them anything from what Allah had bestowed upon them.
 
The siege continued for more than three weeks, until Allah sent a violent wind that uprooted the tents and fires of the confederates. They were terrified and demoralized by this sign of divine wrath. Abu Sufyan realized that his plan had failed and decided to retreat. He announced his departure and urged his allies to follow him. The confederate army dispersed in haste and confusion, leaving behind many dead and wounded. The Muslims rejoiced at this victory and thanked Allah for His help and mercy.
